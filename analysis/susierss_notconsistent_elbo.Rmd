```{r}
library(susieR)
```

Here is a simple example to reproduce the convergence problem when z and R are not consistent.

We simulated 5 variants, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are perfectly correlated, $x_1$ has non-zero effect. We flip the sign of $x_2$.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
X = matrix(rnorm(100*5), 100,5)
X[,1] = X[,2]
b = numeric(5)
b[1] = 1
y = X %*% b + rnorm(100)
ss = susieR:::univariate_regression(X, y)
z = ss$betahat/ss$sebetahat
R = cor(X)
z[2] = -z[2]
```

The z scores are
```{r}
z
```

The LD is
```{r}
R
```

```{r}
f = susie_rss(z, R, max_iter = 100, track_fit = TRUE)
plot(f$elbo)
```
The elbo keeps increasing. It identifies 2 CSs:
```{r}
f$sets$cs
```
